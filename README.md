# LeetCode 75 – My Java Solutions

Hey there! 👋
This repo is my personal workspace for tackling the LeetCode 75 challenge (in Java). Here I’m sharing my daily problem-solving journey, including code, thoughts, and a bit of struggle and fun along the way.

***

## What’s Inside

This project is organized by study days, and covers the full spectrum of the LeetCode 75 plan:

- Arrays \& Strings
- Two pointers
- Linked Lists
- Stack, Queue
- Binary Trees, BST
- Sliding Window, Kadane’s
- Hashing, Prefix/Suffix
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

All code is written in **Java**. Each file includes comments about my approach, edge cases, and test examples.

```
/LeetCode75-DSA
    /Day01
        - Problem1.java
        - Problem2.java
    /Day02
        - Problem3.java
        ...
    /Daynn

    README.md
```

- Organized by study day or topic
- Solutions written in **Java**
- Each problem folder includes:
    - Source code (.java files)
    - Problem statement as code comments

***

## 🏹 How I Solve

- Review the problem statement on LeetCode
- Analyze constraints and optimal approaches
- Check embedded comments for sample inputs, tricky edge cases, and personal notes.
- Most solutions run directly in a Java IDE or using standard javac/java commands.

## 🚩 How to Use

1. Browse solution folders by day/topic
2. Open `.java` file for code and explanation
3. Run locally using Java 8+ (`javac FileName.java` \& `java FileName`)
4. Reference LeetCode for detailed problem statements
